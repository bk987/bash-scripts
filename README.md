# Bash Scripts

A collection of bash scripts that I write mostly for practice while I learn about the linux command line. These scripts are useful for automating some of the repetitive tasks while setting up Debian/Ubuntu based systems and cloud servers.

All scripts are tested and working on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
